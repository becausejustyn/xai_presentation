## To do list

- name the sections correctly, e.g. introduction
- possibly cover the challenge of objective vs subjective measures in user studies
- can frame the conclusion earlier on, so by the time you get to the conclusion it is almost obvious
- explain plots and tables
- explain the explanation
- talk about ambiguity with definitions/terms
- Introduce the need for XAI: add relevant questions 
- Types of XAI I: explain the flowchart, e.g. the differences between post-hoc, transparency, etc.
   - will probably want to remove the `aside` code below it due to overflow
- f 

## Introduction

### Introduce the need for XAI

-   Sentence about AI popularity rising ðŸ“ˆ, increasing its usage ðŸš€, thus a higher emphasis on needing to understand how it works
-   Particularly, we want to address
    -   how do we know we can trust AI?
    -   how do we know if the model is doing what we want?
    -   how can we evaluate if the model is fair?

---

### What is XAI?

-   To address this, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become a key research focus.
-   The general idea is that XAI should ideally help humans understand or see into the blackbox of AI
-   While it may sound simple there are many key challenges with XAI
    -   what is an explanation?
    -   is XAI helpful?
    -   how do we know we can trust XAI?
    -   its name by definition is vague and creates confusion
    -   what type of XAI is best?
